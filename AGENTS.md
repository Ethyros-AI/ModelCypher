## What is ModelCypher?

Geometric diagnostics for LLM representations. Measures intrinsic dimension, curvature, entropy, and similarity to guide model merging, monitor training, and detect behavioral drift.

- **Backend**: MLX (macOS) primary, JAX (Linux/TPU) secondary
- **Architecture**: Hexagonal (ports and adapters)
- **Tests**: ~5800 passing tests

## Commands

```bash
poetry install                    # Install
poetry run pytest                 # Test
poetry run mc --help              # CLI
poetry run modelcypher-mcp        # MCP server
```

## Architecture

```
src/modelcypher/
├── core/
│   ├── domain/        # Pure math + logic (geometry, safety, merging, thermo)
│   ├── ports/         # Abstract interfaces (Backend protocol)
│   └── use_cases/     # Service orchestration
├── adapters/          # Concrete implementations (hf_hub, filesystem)
├── backends/          # MLX, JAX implementations
├── cli/               # Typer CLI
└── mcp/               # MCP server
```

Dependencies point inward. Domain imports nothing external.

## Concurrency Rules

Multiple AI agents work concurrently. Don't pause for unrelated changes.

1. Ignore modified files you don't need to touch
2. No destructive git operations (`add`, `commit`, `push`, `reset`)
3. No bulk modification scripts—edit files individually

## Core Principles

### No NumPy in Core

Use the Backend protocol (79 methods). NumPy only at I/O boundaries.

```python
# Wrong
import numpy as np
mean = np.mean(vectors, axis=0)

# Correct
from modelcypher.core.domain._backend import get_default_backend
backend = get_default_backend()
mean = backend.mean(vectors, axis=0)
```

### Geodesic is Correct

Euclidean distance is the approximation. Geodesic on k-NN graph is exact.

```python
# Wrong
distance = np.linalg.norm(a - b)

# Correct
from modelcypher.core.domain.geometry.riemannian_utils import RiemannianGeometry
rg = RiemannianGeometry(backend)
distances = rg.geodesic_distances(points, k_neighbors=k)
```

### Models Are Always Compatible

Different dimensions = different compression levels of the same geometry. Use Gram matrices for comparison, projection for transformation. Never return "incompatible."

### CKA = 1.0 or Wrong

If CKA < 1.0, debug the alignment code. Don't claim models are incompatible.

### Geometric Addition, NOT Blending

**This is the most important principle. Read it until you understand it.**

LLMs are NOT piles of probabilities to weight. They are HIGH-DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRIC STRUCTURES - like Legos that snap together.

**The goal**: Combine unique knowledge from hundreds of models into ONE denser, smarter model.

**WRONG - Interpolation/Blending**:
```python
# This is WRONG. Never do this.
merged = alpha * model_A + (1 - alpha) * model_B  # Blending
merged = 0.5 * source + 0.5 * target              # Weighted average
merged = lerp(source, target, t)                   # Interpolation
```

Why it's wrong: Interpolation AVERAGES information. You get a smeared, degraded model that's worse than either input. You're not adding knowledge - you're diluting it.

**CORRECT - Null Space Addition**:
```python
# This is CORRECT. Knowledge addition.
delta = source_weights - target_weights
projected = null_space_projection(delta, target_activations)
merged = target_weights + projected
```

Why it works:
- **Null space** = directions the target model doesn't actively use
- Projecting source delta into null space means: **add source knowledge where target has nothing**
- Target behavior is PRESERVED (no interference)
- Source knowledge is ADDED (not averaged)
- Result is DENSER than either model alone

**Think of it like this**:
- Blending: Mixing two paint colors → muddy average
- Addition: Adding ingredients to a recipe → richer dish

**If you find yourself writing weights, alphas, or interpolation** - STOP. You're doing it wrong. The geometry determines how knowledge combines. We don't "weight" anything. We project into null space and ADD.

### No Vibes

Return raw measurements. No hardcoded thresholds, interpretation strings, or qualitative labels.

```python
# Wrong
return {"similarity": 0.73, "interpretation": "Good alignment"}

# Correct
return {"similarity": 0.73}
```

When thresholds are needed, derive from baselines (z-scores, percentiles).

### Don't Invent Heuristics

If you need a parameter value, derive it from data or machine epsilon. Don't fabricate "standard heuristics."

## Research Before Code

AI training data is stale. Before using external APIs:
1. Search for current best practices (use current year in queries)
2. Fetch and read official documentation
3. Check for breaking changes

---

## CLI/MCP First

Never write custom scripts. Use `mc` CLI or MCP tools. If capability doesn't exist, add it to CLI/MCP.
