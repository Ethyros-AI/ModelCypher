This directory contains the drafts for the ModelCypher three-paper series, formerly hosted in TrainingCypher.

## The Series

0.  **Paper 0: The Shape of Knowledge** (Foundational)
    *   *Premise*: Knowledge is high-dimensional geometry; Inference is navigation. A synthesis of the 13 Pillars.
    *   *Key Concept*: "The Cartography of Cognition".

1.  **Paper 1: The Manifold Hypothesis of Agency**
    *   *Premise*: Agentic behavior is a geometric property (a vector), not a prompt.
    *   *Key Concept*: "Agency as a Vector".

2.  **Paper 2: Linguistic Thermodynamics**
    *   *Premise*: Language models behave as physical systems obeying thermodynamic laws (Entropy, Energy).
    *   *Key Concept*: "Entropy Differential" ($\Delta H$) as a safety signal.

3.  **Paper 3: Unified Manifold Alignment**
    *   *Premise*: Disparate models can be stitched together into a single coherent manifold using invariant anchors.
    *   *Key Concept*: "Manifold Stitching" and "Frankenstein Models".
